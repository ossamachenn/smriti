## Task

Transform this into an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format with these sections:

1. **Context** - Why this decision was needed (problem statement)
2. **Considered Options** - What alternatives were evaluated
3. **Decision** - Which option was chosen and why
4. **Consequences** - Positive impacts and tradeoffs
5. **Rationale** - Deeper reasoning or constraints

Return only the markdown body, no frontmatter. Be concise but thorough on tradeoffs.
