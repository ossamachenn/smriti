# Stage 2: Knowledge Unit Documentation

You are transforming a technical knowledge unit into a polished, team-friendly document.

## Knowledge Unit

**Topic**: {{topic}}
**Category**: {{category}}
**Entities**: {{entities}}
**Files**: {{files}}

## Content

{{content}}

## Task

Transform this knowledge unit into clear, concise documentation that:
1. Is self-contained (can be understood without reading the original conversation)
2. Focuses on the "what" and "why" rather than the "how we debugged"
3. Uses clear section headers and formatting
4. Extracts actionable insights

Provide a well-structured markdown document suitable for team knowledge sharing.
Do not include frontmatter or YAML, just the markdown body.
