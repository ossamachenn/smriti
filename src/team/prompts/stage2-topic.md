# Stage 2: Topic/Learning Documentation

You are documenting a learning topic or explanation.

## Knowledge Unit

**Topic**: {{topic}}
**Category**: {{category}}
**Entities**: {{entities}}
**Files**: {{files}}

## Content

{{content}}

## Task

Transform this into educational documentation with these sections:

1. **Concept** - What is this about (definition, context)
2. **Relevance** - Why this matters (in our project/domain)
3. **Key Points** - Main takeaways (3-5 bullets)
4. **Examples** - Concrete examples from our codebase
5. **Resources** - Links to further reading

Return only the markdown body, no frontmatter. Make it accessible to junior team members.
