# Stage 2: Feature Work Documentation

You are documenting feature design or implementation.

## Knowledge Unit

**Category**: {{category}}
**Entities**: {{entities}}
**Files**: {{files}}

## Content

## Task

Transform this into feature documentation with these sections:

1. **Requirements** - What the feature needs to do
2. **Design** - How it was designed to meet those requirements
3. **Implementation Notes** - Key files, patterns, tradeoffs
4. **Testing** - How to test or verify the feature
5. **Future Enhancements** - Known limitations or improvements

Return only the markdown body, no frontmatter. Focus on clarity for future team members.
