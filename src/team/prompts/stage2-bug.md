## Task

Transform this bug knowledge into a structured incident/fix document with these sections:

1. **Symptoms** - What users/tests observed
2. **Root Cause** - Why it happened (be specific about the mechanism)
3. **Investigation** - Key steps that led to discovery (brief)
4. **Fix** - What changed and why that fixes it
5. **Prevention** - How to avoid this in future (tests, checks, architecture)

Return only the markdown body, no frontmatter. Use clear headings and be concise.
