Transform this into a project setup guide with these sections:

1. **What Changed** - What was set up or configured
2. **Why** - The problem or requirement this addresses
3. **Steps** - How to replicate this (commands, files, order)
4. **Verification** - How to verify it worked
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

Return only the markdown body, no frontmatter. Make it step-by-step and actionable.
