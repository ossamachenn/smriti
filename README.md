## 📁 How smriti Organizes Your Data

smriti works by capturing conversations and saving them in your git repository. It uses a format called SQLite for fast data handling. Your conversations are indexed with keywords and timestamps. Later, you can search using plain text.

Because the data is in git, every update is tracked. You can see what changed, who added info, and when. This helps teams avoid losing knowledge or duplicating work.

---

## 🔍 Searching in smriti

Search is simple:

1. Open smriti.  
2. Enter any keyword related to past conversations.  
3. smriti will show relevant results from your team’s stored chats and notes.

You can filter by date, agent (Claude, Codex, etc), or author. This helps find exactly what you need.

---

## 🔧 Settings and Preferences

smriti lets you customize how you work:

- Choose which AI agents’ conversations to index.  
- Set sync schedules to update knowledge from git automatically.  
- Control notifications when new data arrives.  
- Adjust local storage limits to save disk space.

Most users will find defaults work well.

---

## 🛡 Privacy and Security

smriti does not send your data to any cloud service. Your conversations stay inside your team’s git repository only.

All communication with git uses secure SSH or HTTPS protocols, depending on your setup. Make sure your git access is password or key protected.
